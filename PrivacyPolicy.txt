This app requires permission to write to the device's file system in order to save files converted on the request of the user.
We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data from the user or the device.
All files created or saved remain on the user's device and are only accessible to the user.
This permission is used solely for the core functionality of the app â€” allowing users to convert and save files to a folder they choose.

Email Sharing
This app may offer the ability to send converted files via email by opening your preferred email application.
This feature is completely user-initiated, and no email is sent automatically by the app.
The app does not access, collect, or store any email content, addresses, or attachments.
All data remains local on your device, and sending the file is entirely under your control through the selected email app.
Only files created or converted by the user within the app are ever offered as email attachments. No other files or personal data are accessed or shared.

We do not share any information with third parties.
